                RLT App Store is a robot with a passion for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) on the Android platform. 
                On this site youâ€™ll find a repository of FOSS apps, along with an Android client to perform installations 
                and updates, news, reviews, and other features covering all things Android and software-freedom related.
                RLT App Store not only focuses on end-users but also offers OEMs and telecoms the opportunity to have their own app 
                store based on API or co-brand solution. Our goal? Taking app discovery to the next level.
